    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>I am a daughter of God, teacher, photographer, aspiring web developer and graphic designer.</p>
    <p>Living in South Africa, specifically in a small surfers' paradise called Jeffreys Bay, I am surrounded by an unparalleled natural beauty. I've developed a passion for capturing these scenes on my Nikon D7200 - anything from wildlife to landscapes to sports. My dream is to one day share these photos with the world on my own, custom made website, and to offer prints and commissioned pieces for sale.</p>
    <p>At the moment, I teach natural sciences to primary school students. I love seeing kids learn to love and appreciate the natural world around them and enjoy helping them embrace their natural curiosity.</p>
    <p>During the national lockdown due to Covid-19 in 2020, my work landscape underwent a drastic change. Learning couldn't take place in person anymore and we had to move onto an online system. This led me down the path of learning basic html coding and website administration. I've always had a love for all things computer related, which inspired me to pursue a second career.</p>
    <p>My hope is to transition out of teaching into a job I can do for many years to come, working for myself on my own terms.</p>
